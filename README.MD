# Combo Image Editor
This is a Python program that applies some simple effects to images, including:
- 90-Degree Image Rotation.
- Image Flipping (Horizontally and Vertically)
- Image Resizing.
- Image Translation.
- Changing Color Schemes (Negative, Grayscale, Binary, HSV, LAB, etc...).
- Applying Intensity Effects to Grayscale Images (Log Transformation, Gamma Transformation, Histogram Equalization, Contrast Stretching).
- Applying Edge Detection (Sobel, Canny).
- Applying Different Filters and Effects (Blur, Sharpen, Noise, Quantization, Dithering (Grayscale Only), Median Cut (Does Not Work on Grayscale)).
- Showing Histogram for RGB and Grayscale Modes for Images.
- Image Compression.
- Images with current changes can be saved and stored on computer.

## Notes
- Run the program by simply double-clicking the __Combo Image Editor.exe__ file.
- The program's window may take a few seconds (after clicking the EXE) before it shows up. So please, be a bit patient.
- The idea of this program is to combine features of two image processing apps (with different features) developed for my college:
